		<h1>The Rules</h1>
		<ul class="rules">
			<li>The computer sets a number to guess (for simplicity called abcd).</li>
			<li>You are trying to guess. At each turn you enter a four-digit number (for simplicity called xyzw).</li>
			<li>Sheep means that a digit from xyzw is contained in abcd, but not on the same position. If two such digits exists, the sheep are 2.</li>
			<li>The leftmost digit must not be 0 (zero).</li>
			<li>Ram means that a digit from xyzw is contained in abcd and it is on the same position. If two such digits exists, the rams are 2.</li>
			<li>The game continues until you guess the number abcd i.e. you get 4 rams.</li>
